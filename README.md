### Project Overview

 The Olympic Games, considered to be the world's foremost sports competition has more than 200 nations participating across the Summer and Winter Games alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart.
Throughout this project, we will explore the Olympics dataset(scraped from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-time_Olympic_Games_medal_table) , look at some interesting statistics and then try to find out which country is the King of Olympic Games.
The dataset has details of 146 countries with 16 features.



### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, I got a better understanding of data handling with python(pandas). In this project, I learnt to apply the following concepts :
Dataframe operations,
Conditional statement and loops,
List operations,
Bar Plotting,
Mathematical operations.



### Approach taken to solve the problem

 In this dataset there are two main events mainly summer and winter so firstly I created a new column Better_Event that stores 'Summer','Winter' or 'Both' based on the comparision between the total medals won in Summer event and Winter event. Then I figured out which is a better event for each country.Plotted the medal count of the top 10 countries for better visualisation,  found out which country has had the best performance with respect to the ratio between gold medals won and total medals won.Finally I found the top country based on the total points achieved during the olympic games.
